# Huevo y Queso
A speed runny platformer game using Unity.

## Getting Started

All the assets are kept on DropBox, using the AutoZip.py script to track changes between versions.
AutoTrigger.py will take all the public variables on Huevo and turn them into "triggers" for modifying any of them in-game!

Most of the functionality is within Assets/Scripts/Huevo.cs, in the future it would be worth refactoring the physics code in to its own class.

### Prerequisites

Unity3D, originally made with 4.6 but likely works with newer versions.
Python 3.x if you wise to use the python utilities.
